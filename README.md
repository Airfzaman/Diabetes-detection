## 🚀 Key Features

-  **Multiple Models**: Compare Logistic Regression and SVM
-  **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing data, feature scaling, and class imbalance techniques like SMOTE.
-  **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
-  **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained model.
-  **Optional UI Integration**: Can be deployed with Flask, Streamlit, or integrated into full-stack apps.

## 📈 Dataset train and test

The dataset is divided into two parts train and test. The train dataset have 80% and test
dataset have 20%. The train dataset is used to train the model and test dataset is used
to test the model.


## 📊Model Performance (Sample Metrics)

| Classification      | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| SVM                 | 0.65      | 0.65   | 0.65     | 75%      |
| Logistic Regression | 0.68      | 0.67   | 0.67     | 77%      |


## Why This Project Matters
- Healthcare Impact: Early prediction of diabetes can support timely medical intervention.
- Data Science Practice: Incorporates real-world solutions like data cleansing, model comparison, and handling imbalance.
- Production-ready: Streamable model pipeline and optional UI make it deployable.
- Skill Demonstration: Perfect for showcasing ML workflow—from EDA, to training, to deployment.
